### Frequenct analysis script

This is a "frequency of commitments and code changes" script, it does multiple things:

- Creates graph of deletions and additions on the same fig with graphs of commits activity of
  each contributor: combining data of additions and deletions with number of commits by scaling;
- Because scaling data causes "corruption" of perception, it also displays two "raw" graphs of:
  - Raw code frequency graph;
  - Raw commit activity by contributors graph;
